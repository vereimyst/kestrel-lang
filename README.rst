**[News]** Kestrel session at `Black Hat USA 2022`_ [`BH'22 recording`_ | `BH'22 hunting lab`_]

--------

Kestrel is a threat hunting language aiming to make cyber threat hunting *fast*
by providing a layer of abstraction to build reusable, composable, and
shareable hunt-flow.

`Try Kestrel in a cloud sandbox without install`_ (Blog: `Try Kestrel in a Cloud Sandbox`_).

Software developers write Python or Swift than machine code to quickly turn
business logic into applications. Threat hunters write Kestrel to quickly turn
threat hypotheses into hunt-flow. We see threat hunting as an interactive
procedure to create customized intrusion detection systems on the fly, and
hunt-flow is to hunts as control-flow is to ordinary programs.

What does it mean by *hunt fast*?

- Do not write the same TTP pattern in different data source queries.
- Do not write one-time-use adapaters to connect hunt steps.
- Do not waste your existing analytic scripts/programs in future hunts.
- Do construct your hunt-flow from smaller reuseable hunt-flow.
- Do share your huntbook with your future self and your colleagues.
- Do get interactive feedback and revise hunt-flow on the fly.

Kestrel in a Nutshell
=====================

.. image:: https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang/raw/develop/docs/images/overview.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Kestrel overview.

- **Kestrel language**: a threat hunting language for a human to express *what to
  hunt*.

  - expressing the knowledge of *what* in patterns, analytics, and hunt flows.
  - composing reusable hunting flows from individual hunting steps.
  - reasoning with human-friendly entity-based data representation abstraction.
  - thinking across heterogeneous data and threat intelligence sources.
  - applying existing public and proprietary detection logic as analytic hunt steps.
  - reusing and sharing individual hunting steps, hunt-flow, and entire huntbooks.

- **Kestrel runtime**: a machine interpreter that deals with *how to hunt*.

  - compiling the *what* against specific hunting platform instructions.
  - executing the compiled code locally and remotely.
  - assembling raw logs and records into entities for entity-based reasoning.
  - caching intermediate data and related records for fast response.
  - prefetching related logs and records for link construction between entities.
  - defining extensible interfaces for data sources and analytics execution.
